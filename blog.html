				<p>On my relationship with my disabilities.</p>

				<p><b>Content warning:</b> mentions of suicidality, ableist slur.</p>

				</ol>
				
				<br>
				
				<h2 id="autism"><a class="self-link" href="#autism">§</a>Autism</h2>

				<p>I would never choose to 'cure' my autism, but there are things I try to manage. Take sensory sensitivities — I use earbuds and sunglasses to filter out the noise and I'm genuinely glad to have all those nice tools at hand. Or take the issue of not feeling time — I have an app that declares time every hour and my automatic response to that if often to thank it. But does that mean I love having the issues themselves? No. Just the tools.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>There are many autistic joys I have, like editing a large spreadsheet, coding my website, riding a bike, and all the other special interests and hyperfixations. I love my stim-toys, I love gently rocking. Hyperfocusing on drawing or writing gives me peace of mind. I take pride in my strong sense of justice and non-conconformity.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>There are also many downsides like clumsiness, sensory overloads, shutdowns, aversions, and a struggle to adapt to hyper-capitalism that demands swiftness and productivity from a slow and fatigued me. And I struggled at school so much. Just how many times my teachers called me an idiot...</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>My depression is very hard to treat and I don't know anymore where the boundary between depression and autism is. I've always lacked the spoons to do shit and been suicidal. My psychiatrist said that my depression might have a 'bipolar mechanism', whatever that is, so maybe that's why it has always been this way. But it might as well be autism what truly disables me and makes me tired all the time. All the sensory information, the amount of stuff to process and desicions to make, it's exhausting. I often feel that I just can't keep up. Life goes too fast for me to ever catch up. Too many things are happening in the same time.</p>
				
				<br>

				<h2 id="anxiety"><a class="self-link" href="#anxiety">§</a>Anxiety disorder</h2>

				<p>I've always had crippling anxiety. When I was just a baby, my mother had to place the crib right next to her bed and lay her hand on me, otherwise I'd cry and couldn't sleep. It has become better with medication, but I find myself relapsing every now and then. Sometimes it's so hard to call or record a plain voice message: my voice trembles and I can't breathe normally. Sometimes my stomach gets so upset that I can't keep up with my responsibilities. I haven't seen a doctor other than a psychiatrist in ages, because my heart goes nuts when I just think about making an appointment.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>I can't really say that my anxiety disorder and depression did something positive to me. It just makes my life worse.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>People say that disorders of that sort make them more thoughtful and compassionate. I'd been a trans activist for a few years and I currently maintain a small community of my own, but I think it's simply due to my personality. Or it's autism and its sense of justice, again. I think I could never in a life experience a panic attack and still try to comfort those who do. Sure, I don't want people to feel miserable like I do, but isn't it just a completely normal, average thing not to wish pain upon others? It's tragic if it isn't. But I am hopeful about society. We just hear the horror stories more often than the happy ones, because, well, in the age of social media that drives engagement and thus money.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>If I weren't anxious, could I be an advocate for human rights? I truly don't know what made me sensitive to other people's problems. There was no before and after the anxiety came in to compare those times. No way to know. Maybe it's easier for folks who developed a mental disorder later in life.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>Even if that was true, that I truly am patient and understanding because it's a 'gift' of my anxiety disorder, does it worth it? Sometimes I feel like I'm too soft of a person, because I can't deal with assholes. Being nice isn't always a good strategy. I can't yell and I cry if people raise their voice at me. I'm not confrontational even within reason and even if that could actually benefit me, e.g. protecting my boundaries or defending my rights. The amount of frustration outweights all supposedly positive stuff that isn't even necesserily a side effect of these frustrations. (But don't get me wrong — being an activist was worth it, every bit of it, just that I'm not sure there's a causation link.)</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>I can't imagine myself completely 'healed' of depression and especially anxiety. Do I want to treat them? Definitely. But do I loathe them? No, I don't. Because...</p>
				
				<br>

				<h2 id="it-is-what-it-is"><a class="self-link" href="#it-is-what-it-is">§</a>It is what it is</h2>
				 
				<p>I don't really want or need to measure how much happiness or suffering autism and anxiety disorder bring me. I'm just not willing to as I'm proud of who I am. These are the parts of who I am and I value that, too. I treasure everything about myself even if I don't like it, because how else would I be able to go on.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>If I call my disability a gift, it feels like I'm desperately trying to justify my existence to ableists who want to discard me given the chance but are somehow supposed to have mercy on me because I have this 'gift' I may (or must) contribute to society.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>My disabilities are neutral. They don't have to bring anything good to me and the world around me. Nor do they make my life worthless. I refuse to measure their value at all, because I believe that's ableist and eugenics-y in and of itself. We measure person's worth based on their 'usefulness' and trying to ascribe value to disabilities is kinda the same thing to me. It doesn't really mean anything if it is positive or not. It should be honored in any case for that is a part of being human.</p>
				
				<br>

				<p>I'm disabled, that's my identity and it defines a lot of things in my life. I'll probably never excel at the capitalism shit show, but I'm okay with it. I'd rather not lose my humanity than that.</p>

					A year on medication

				<br>
				<p><b>Content warning:</b> mentions of suicidality; discussion of sex and body weight.</p>
				<br>
				<p>There are many ups and downs in this journey and I'm still far from reaching a conclusion.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I managed to go to a private trans-friendly phychiatrist for free for quite a while thanks to a charity. </p>
				<br>
				<p>We'd begun with sertraline and gabapentin. For the first month there wasn't a lot of progress, but small things like music did start bringing me joy. I started to have pleasant lucid dreams, but only temporarily. In one of such I walked in a museum of contemporary art, enjoying every small detail and every colour as if they were real.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On the third month lithium was added to my plan and there were significant positive changes. I started being more assertive rather than resorting to my usual flight or freeze response. I stopped getting irritated by relatives and cats. I began doing small social interactions such as recording a voice message and calling with ease. There were quite a few side effects like slight nausea, teary eyes, waking up in a cold sweat, but it didn't bother me. The only effect that did was frustratingly low muscle strength. Because of that I stopped taking lithium.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The doctor figured I switch from sertraline to venlafaxine to help me focus more, but it failed at that, besides it gave me intrusive suicidal thoughts and intense derealization episodes. The only positive thing in comparison to sertraline was slightly restored libido.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I switched back to sertraline, and buspirone was added to the plan. At this point I was seeing a psychiatrist for half a year. I virtually stopped getting flashbacks and feeling soul-crushing guilt for my mistakes. I gradually started to work and it was easier to begin drawing something new.</p> 
				<br>
				<p>Speaking of sex life, it got really hard to achieve an orgasm. It's like you get somewhere near the peak but you can never reach it. However If I did get orgasms, they were fascinating and long, maybe because I spent more time unintentionally edging myself. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Almost a year in I suddenly lost a lot of progress and I suspect I developed drug resistance. So my psychiatrist drastically changed my plan and prescribed olanzapine and fluoxetine instead of sertraline. As of writing, I'm taking them for four months. Improvements are very slow. For now what is most apparent is side effects. The libido is now non-existant and I don't really care about it as I didn't only lose the ability to reach an orgasm but also the sexual desire in general. I want to sleep all the time, but seems like it's improving a bit over time. I occassionally get hypomanic episodes when I feel very productive and stay awake for 18 hours or more, but those are rare. There's a thing I take a lot of joy in, and it's weight gain. I was always struggling to gain weight. I gained 17 kg since the start of taking meds, and I genuinely like my newly fat folds so much.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I spend my days mostly by sleeping, but it gets better every day, I think. I have less suicidal thoughts. Going to a phychiatist got a bit trickier as I now go to a state-owned clinic (it provides services free of charge in my country although its quality is sometimes much much lower than those of private clinics), but I have the most important thing now — hope. It's the best I got so far.</p>

				<p>James wrote a post about <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/11/22/things-that-bring-me-joy/">things that bring him joy</a>, so I figured I give that a try too!</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love sitting on the riverbank and gazing at the sparkling waters.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love the feeling of freedom my bicycle gives me. It is a special kind of freedom — the one that is also safe and carefree.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love volunteering and helping people whenever I can.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love my girlfriend and making her happy. I knows she loves it when I take photos for her so I don't miss an opportunity to do just that. And I admire that both of us are polyamorous, nonbinary, and neurodivergent. It's beautiful and empowering.</p>

				<p>My favourite colour is pink. It's soothing.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love decluttering and sorting things. Lists and spreadsheets are awesome. It's as if I'm sorting out stuff in my brain, too.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love to build my website and learn new things in HTML and CSS.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love to play a carefree videogame, usually walking simulators and simple puzzles fall into this category.</p>

				<p>I love how green my town is. Nature is all around. There're swamps, lakes, mountains, rivers, and all kinds of picturesque landscapes.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love traveling and seeing new places.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love live concerts. When the organ plays everything trembles and you feel all the vibrations go through your body, it's invigorating.</p>

				<h2 id="intro"><a class="self-link" href="#intro">§</a>Intro</h2>
				<p>You <i>really</i> look each other in the eye? Embarrassing.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Content warning:</b> discussion of, well, sex. Also hints at suicidal thoughts, and outdated language regarding transgenderness.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Craving some inspiration for this post, I went to Google Scholar and typed ‘autism and sexual behaviour.’ The results fit roughly into two categories: ‘inappropriate behaviours’ and ‘oh look, autistics have interest in sex, who would’ve thought!’. My inquery did not last long as I stumbled upon ‘[d]eviant sexual behavior includes…object fetishism, transvestism, and self-bondage…’ and closed the tab. I could tolerate some level of outdated language, but ‘transvestism’ in 2015? Come the fuck on.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I do not believe ‘transvestism’ has any ground in reality. While on the inside a trans person just <i>feels</i> happy to put on a dress, a cis person on sees arousal on the outside that they mistake for being sexual<a id="back" href="#1">¹</a> and thus conclude that it’s a fetish. When you frame something as a fetish, a deviance, it’s easier to pathologize it than a state of joy and belonging it actually is. To pathologize is to oppress and deny the necessary accomodations.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Just as gender dysphoria and euphoria were sexualized and pathologized by cis people observing trans people from the outside, so are autistic traits. Just how much could’ve we been doing what’s perfectly human, but is regarded as ‘inappropriate’ and ‘deviant’?</p>
				<br>
				<h2 id="dating"><a class="self-link" href="#dating">§</a>The fuck is dating?</h2>
				<p>I can’t distinguish between my autism and demisexuality. I’m not attracted to people sexually until we’re close friends. Perhaps some neurotypical could look at the likes of me and conclude that all autistics have dimished interest in sex. But on the inside that is simply not true. I’m interested, but at a certain point. When you reach it, I start to be horny all the time.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I guess you could call my approach pragmatic. How could I know if a person is any good for me if all I have of them is their look? That tells me nothing about their personality, worldview, feelings, etc.</p>
				<br>				
				<p>Okay, you might wonder, this is clearly demisexuality, but what’s autistic about it? I don’t know. It just feels that way. It has to do with relying on more objective things in general. Beauty is a social contruct, too, but personality and views are more tangible.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I don’t get to be very close with people often, so I, in my mid-twenties, didn’t even have a first kiss yet, let alone sex with someone. Doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want to. My sexual life is masturbating and sexting my remote girlfriend. Did you know that having irl relationships is a priviledge, by the way? Now you know for sure. My love and friendships are not lesser than just because they are online. Without them I’d be completely alone (and most likely dead).</p>
				<br>
				<h2 id="camouflaging"><a class="self-link" href="#camouflaging">§</a>Camouflaging</h2>
				<p>Sexting is cool, but there’s a caveat: If a thing involves a fellow human, I gotta camouflage, no matter how close we are.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I’m hyper-aware of how others perceive me, and even if my partner doesn’t hear and see me, I’ll perform for them. I’ll exaggerate moans. At some point I could feel like I’m trying to climax only to please my girlfriend, simply because I know she’ll be happy to hear that. They know I’m on SSRIs and it’s not like they wouldn’t be understanding. It’s still hard to focus on my own pleasure and not just hers. Can’t imagine what a disaster our first night irl will be. It’ll be obvious how tense I’m due to masking.</p>
				<br>
				<h2 id="consent"><a class="self-link" href="#consent">§</a>Consent</h2>
				<p>I always took a ‘no’ literally. If I wanna date someone and they say ‘no’, I’ll not pursue them. Before I discovered I’m autistic, I thought that that’s just what normal people should do, but apparantly neurotypical brain doesn’t work that way (sadly).</p>
				<br>
				<p>It’s awkward to ask things in a straightforward fashion. But if I don’t, how am I gonna know <i>for sure?</i> If there’s no ‘yes’, how could I know? What if I mistake a dubious ‘no’ for a ‘yes’ accidentally? I better not risk. The only thing that is more awkward is how the actual fuck is this not what the majority of people do! Go be brutally honest with your partner and ask them ‘Wanna have sex?’ and let them reciprocate with brutally honest ‘yes’ or ‘no’!</p>
				<br>
				<h2 id="eye-contact"><a class="self-link" href="#eye-contact">§</a>Eye contact</h2>
				<p>I don’t look people in the eye, not only in real life, but also while looking at photos. If I open a dating app, people’s large eyes start to drill through my very soul. It’s unnerving and makes me want to scream and run away. Eye contact is way too much stimuli for my autistic ass to handle. In case of photos it’s even more intense, because the face is closer than it normally is in real life interactions.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I never liked eye contact like they do that in porn and movies. Something like ‘Twilight’ is basically protagonists staring at each other intensely for an hour and a half. Not my love language.</p>
				<br>
				<p>But it’s especially weird in sex. If you gonna bring me some oral pleasure, can I just have it without a sensory overload? Y’know, there’re already things going on, no? Don’t faces look stupid at this angle? Oh, and also if you are the receiver, you better not ask me to look you in the eye, because my stare is… something. I get mistaken to be angry when in reality I’m just having a neutral face. It’s ten times worse when looking up.</p>
				<br>
				<h2 id="stimming"><a class="self-link" href="#stimming">§</a>Stimming</h2>
				<p>Finally I’m approaching the part that actually has nothing to do with sex: Stimming by touching one’s genitalia or chest. I know I do that, like pinching nipples, knocking on a clit, or twisting pubic hair. But I may also use a vibrator as a stim toy, it really grounds me and does not at all arouse me. I wonder how much of these instances of ‘public masturbation’ they like to talk about in scientific papers is just stimming with no sexual intent in the slightest. Genitalia is just a body part. It’s society that prescribes it sexual meaning.</p>
				<br>
				<hr>
				<br>
				<p>All of the above is just my personal experience and shouldn’t be taken as gospel. Autistic folks are all very different!</p>
				<br>
				<p id="1"><a href="#back">¹</a> Gender euphoria <i>can</i> manifest as sexual arousal. It comes from finally feeling love for one’s body and having enough self-confidence to engage in sexual activities. The point is, it’s not the only way gender euphoria can manifest as.</p>

					Excerpts from 'Against Technoableism'<br> by Ashley Shew

				<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="icon" src="images/icon-clock.svg" alt="Reading time"><span class="readingtime">4-minute read</span></p>
				
				<br>

				<p>Quotes from the book that I find particularly interesting. I've taken all of them from its last chapter, 'Accessible Futures':</p> 
				
				<br>
				
				<h2>***</h2>
				
				<p>Technofuturists want to believe that in the future utopia there will be no disability. But despite eugenic and transhumanist imagination about perfecting human beings, about life extension, about regenerative medicine, about neural implants, and the merging of “man” and machine, the fact is that in the future, we can expect more disability, not less. We should expect both more ways to be disabled and more people existing with disabilities. <i>The future is disabled.</i></p>
				<br>
				<p><i>The future is disabled for each individual.</i> We can never have too many reminders that anyone who lives long enough can expect disability eventually; disability is a very normal and predictable part of the human experience.</p>
					
				<br>
				
				<h2>***</h2>	
					
				<p><i>The future is disabled for humanity writ large.</i> As a species, we face environmental disaster, pollution, and climate change. Environmental racism has already wrought disproportionate damage to human health with our decisions about where to site environmental hazards like interstates, gas pipelines, landfills, and so on, and this will only get worse as the number of healthy, habitable locations is reduced by climate change. Pollution is increasing rates of environmentally produced disease and disability—higher levels and lower onset ages of different types of cancers, as well as rising rates of asthma, chemical sensitivities, and autoimmune disabilities, some of which can come from smog and conditions of poor air quality. Think about all the people along the West Coast who breathed in toxic smoke from wildfires for weeks on end in 2021: these kinds of environmental health hazards are only going to increase.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h2>***</h2>
					
				<p><i>The future is disabled for the planet itself.</i> Sunaura Taylor, a fellow disabled scholar who is an animal and environmental activist, writes powerfully of the “disabled ecologies” that constitute the landscapes we have impaired. Her case study is the Superfund site in Tucson, Arizona, which contaminated local groundwater and, forty years later, is still affecting the land and communities nearby. She thinks disabled people have important insight into how to live and age and exist with disabled ecologies. She reminds us that we can’t just get rid of our land, our environment. We have to learn how to live in a world we have disabled.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h2>***</h2>
					
				<p><i>The future is disabled, cosmically.</i> Even with hopeful futures like space travel and adventure, we can expect the production of disability. Space is already disabling for humans. Just as the built environment on Earth is not suited for disabled bodies, space as an environment is not suited to any human bodies. Every astronaut comes back from the low gravity of space with damage to their bones and eyes—and the longer they are off Earth’s surface, the worse the damage. Some things can be restored over time, but some changes are long-lasting. These realities are absent from futurist writing about technology, which is framed as simply magicking away the disabling effects of space travel.</p>
				<br>	
				<p>This is why technofuturists’ discussions of “The End of Disability” are so silly. Disability isn’t ending; we’re going to see more and newer forms of disability in the future. This doesn’t mean that all medical projects aimed at treating disease and disability are unpromising. I certainly hope we will come up with better diagnosis and treatment for conditions like asthma and Lyme disease. But disability is multifaceted and a much larger category than can be covered by any simple case. <i>No nondisabled person without experiential knowledge of disability and engagement with the disability community should be making claims or decisions about the future of disability and disabled people.</i></p>
				<br>	
				<p>Because the future is disabled, working toward and planning for a future without disability, without disabled people, is a <i>ridiculous prospect.</i></p>
				
				<br>

				<p>In 2018, Sheri Wells-Jensen, blind linguist, banjo player, and my Facebook friend, made “The Case for Disabled Astronauts” in Scientific American. She wrote about how useful it would be to have a totally blind crew member aboard. Spacesuits would need to be better designed to transmit tactile information, but a blind astronaut would be unaffected by dim or failed lighting or vision loss from smoke, able to respond unimpeded, unclouded, to such an emergency—Wells-Jensen refers to a problem on the Mir where they couldn’t find the fire extinguisher when the lights went out.</p>

				<p>Recruiting for space has always held up certain bodies as better than others, in ways that don’t at all map onto what might actually work best.</p>

				<p>Disabled people don’t have the same disadvantages in space that they may have here on Earth—especially if we work to avoid creating or re-creating disadvantages in how we build and plan for space.</p>

				<p>In case you don’t know, it’s very difficult to poop in space—both in terms of physical properties and engineering-wise. Astronauts have to train to use specialized toilets (there is a whole toilet-engineering team with each space agency), and the toilets are finicky and have a history of breaking. Because pooping is so complicated, Mallory has suggested that NASA should only be recruiting people with ostomies—people who have openings in their abdomens (called stomas) to excrete waste using ostomy bags. All the engineering and work that currently goes into space toilets is only necessary because no one has an ostomy!</p>

				<p>This page is a work in progress more than any page of this website! Degoogling ain't easy at all and doesn't happen overnight. But I find joy in the process as I realize how much more cozy my devices now are. It made me more attentive. There's some beauty in replacing one app with a bunch that I cannot yet describe. Mayhaps the smaller and more specific a tool is, the more it is thoughtful and genuine? Human-scale, I guess.</p>

					<h2 id="successful"><a class="self-link" href="#successful">§</a>Successful replacements</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><b>Play Store</b> — F-Droid with additional repos (IzzyOnDroid, Bitwarden, Thunderbird), Aurora Store for the apps that are not on F-Droid or any other official resources.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Pay (Wallet?)</b> — Catima.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Calendar</b> — Literally a physical calendar hanging on the wall.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Files</b >— Material Files.</p>
							</li>
			
							<li>
								<p><b>Gboard</b> — HeliBoard.</p>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<p><b>Keep</b> — Quillpad (Android), Joplin (PC), and Standard Notes for those that need to be synchronized across devices. I know Joplin is available for Android too, but I like Quillpad visually.</p>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<p><b>Drive</b> — transferring files via a USB-cable. If files are large, I can create a torrent file with Deluge and seed it to whoever I want to send it to.</p>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<p><b>Chrome</b> — Brave and sometimes TOR (PC), Fennec (Android). I'm not quite satisfied that I'm still on a chromium-based browser (which is Brave), but it's been great so far.</p>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<p><b>Search engine</b> — DuckDuckGo + uBlacklist add-on, sometimes Marginalia. Have to occasionally use Yandex (yet another big tech corpo…) for searching by image. It's damn good at it. Also I hate DuckDuckGo shoving the AI assistant down my throat.</p>
							</li>
							
						</ul>
					
					<h2 id="wip"><a class="self-link" href="#wip">§</a>Partially successful, still needs work</h2>

						<ul>
							
							<li>
								<p><b>Photos</b> — Fossify Gallery. Personally I don't need a cross-platform app and sync here, I transfer photos via USB. I never relied on syncing, because I'm annoyed I don't have full control over how files present themselves (I love folders and bulk renaming with FastStone Image Viewer). But I find no other good option for making small edits to videos, like removing sound, cropping, and trimming. Open Video Editor that I used for some time is so buggy.</p>
							</li>
					
							<li>
								<p><b>Gmail</b> — ProtonMail, Thunderbird (PC), K-9 (Android). It's a bummer PM doesn't let users to use their bridge and PC app without a subscription.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Docs and Sheets</b> — LibreOffice (offline, PC). Can't find an alternative, especially an ecosystem type, that doesn't suck ass visually <i>and</i> can sync files across my devices. I slowly move my stuff to LibreOffice but some spreadsheets are a real pain to convert to .ods.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>YouTube</b> — I used FreeTube (PC) for a while, but the app died I guess. Not that much of a deal, because I kinda stopped watching YouTube much anyway.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

				<p>With my current comment system I can't reply to comments, so I'm leaving the answer here.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>Why degoogle? Mainly because I don't like it when YouTube recommends me videos based on the contents of my Keep notes and searches, it feels intrusive and invasive. I also don't like the feeling of relying on a greedy giant corporation so much, I just don't want to entrust my data to them anymore.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>As for other corporations: I try to switch from the likes of Microsoft and Adobe to other software, too. It's just that Google took the most of space in my life out of all these corpos.</p>
