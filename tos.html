				<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
				
				<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="icon" src="images/icon-clock.svg" alt="Reading time"><span class="readingtime">4-minute read</span></p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h2 id="general"><a class="self-link" href="#general">§</a>General</h2>
				
				<p>As long as you credit me and have no commercial incentive, you are free to:</p>
					<ul class="star">
						<li>reupload/repost my artworks.</li>
						<li>make derivative art that isn't generative AI.</li>
						<li>feature my art and posts in your videos, blog posts, etc.</li>
					</ul>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>When crediting me, linking to this website rather than social media is preferred.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h2 id="general"><a class="self-link" href="#AI">§</a>AI</h2>
				
				<p><b>I prohibit the usage of my works in any proximity to generative AI and NFTs.</b> The works include but are not limited to: texts, code, art, video, audio, GIFs, files, etc. Do not upload my art into generative AIs. Do not use any of the data of this website and my social media accounts to train AI. Do not place my works next to AI-generated and/or NFT content, including but not limited to: AI-generated alt text, images, summaries, texts, code, etc.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h2 id="commissions"><a class="self-link" href="#commissions">§</a>Commissions</h2>
				
				<p>By commissioning an artwork you agree to the terms of service stated below. They apply when you make your first payment. These terms are subject to change, but I will rely on the version present at the time of the first payment.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><b>DONT'S:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li><span aria-hidden="true">🚫</span> kids younger than 14.</li>
						<li><span aria-hidden="true">🚫</span> severe gore.</li>
						<li><span aria-hidden="true">🚫</span> imitation of someone else's style.</li>
						<li><span aria-hidden="true">🚫</span> digital art, for now.</li>
						<li><span aria-hidden="true">🚫</span> anything having to do with AI or NFT.</li>
					</ul>
				
				<p>Everything else goes (most likely).</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><b>USE EMAIL TO COMMISSION ME,</b> that will ensure reliable communication: <a href="mailto:mx.poesu@proton.me">mx.poesu@proton.me</a></p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><b>70% PAID UPFRONT.</b> The rest is paid before I send you a scan of the finished artwork. Don't send me the payment before I've requested you to do so. Otherwise I'll consider it a donation.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><b>REVISIONS:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li><span aria-hidden="true">📃</span> <b>rough sketch:</b> unlimited, if general idea doesn't change.</li>
						
						<li><span aria-hidden="true">✏️</span> <b>pencil lineart:</b> 2 revisions for free, only insignificant edits and details allowed; further revisions charged from $1 depending on the amount of work needed.</li>
						
						<li><span aria-hidden="true">🖼️</span> <b>colouring and acrylic lineart:</b> not allowed, because edits at this stage are either too difficult, or impossible since I'm a traditional artist.</li>
					</ul>
					
				<br>
				
				<p><b>SHIPPING AND REFUNDS</b> unavailable.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><b>PRIVATE COMMISSIONS</b> unavailable. I will not work under an NDA. I don't work on commissions that I'm not allowed to publish when finished on my own, but I can put the post on hold if your commission is a gift for someone. You are free to post the final artwork publicly with a credit.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><b>COMMERCIAL USE</b> negotiable. By default no commercial use rights are given. I retain all rights over the artwork, including the right to post it publicly. If you want to negotiate commercial rights after the fact, contact me first.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><b>NO GENERATIVE AI</b> used or will ever be used at any stage of my art process, including conception, references, processing, etc. I will not accept AI-generated text or 'art' as a reference.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p><b>PRICE-LIST</b> coming soon.</p>
